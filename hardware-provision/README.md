- For Pi's, k3sup needs these flags set inside `/boot/firmware/cmdline.txt`
  - cgroup_enable=cpuset
  - cgroup_memory=1
  - cgroup_enable=memory
- Since we are also using NVME hats, we should add this flag inside `/boot/firmware/config.txt`
  - dtparam=pciex1_gen=3
- If using wireless and router does auto band switching from 2.4ghz to 5ghz, make sure you edit NetworkManager settings to prefer one
